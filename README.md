[ci]: https://ci.wertarbyte.com/job/Dyablewood/lastStableBuild/

## Usage
Wood planks and anything that is made out of it (and available in multiple wood types) can be dyed by
crafting it with a dye.

| Dye              | Resulting wood type  |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Dandelion Yellow | Oak Wood             |
| Cocoa Beans      | Spruce Wood          |
| Bone Meal        | Birch Wood¹          |
| Rose Red         | Jungle Wood          |
| Orange Dye       | Acacia Wood          |
| Cocoa Beans²     | Dark Oak Wood        |

¹Except for Dark Oak Wood, which turns into Spruce Wood when dyed with Bone Meal.

²Put Cocoa Beans on two slots to dye any wood type to Dark Oak Wood. Except for
Spruce Wood, which is already pretty brown and thus only needs one Cocoa
Bean to be dyed to Dark Oak Wood.
